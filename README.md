# Pandas Challenge
Pandas Challenge using Jupyter

### Heroes of Pymoli

This challenge dealt with in-game transactions for an online game called Heroes of Pymoli. I was provided a csv file with transactions and tasked with sorting and grouping the data by gender, player, and item purchased using pandas built in Jupyter Notebook. 

#### Observations

1) Individuals between 20-24 represented the largest group to make purchases by a wide margin. 15-29 contains the vast majority of all individuals making purchases, suggesting that teenagers, college-age individuals, and young adults is a worthwhile target audience for their in-game transactions. 

2) Males are the vast majority of transactions, both in number (84%) and in portion of total revenue (82%)

3) Most purchases are not coming from repeat buyers. There are 780 transactions but 576 unique individuals making purchases. This may be beacuse the developers are making one-time-buy items, where it may benefit them to offer "consumable" items to get repeat buyers.
